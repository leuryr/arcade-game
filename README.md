# Arcade Game Clone

This project is a clone of the classic arcade game **Frogger**.

## Running The Game

Download and unpack the repository to your computer, then open `index.html` to run the game in your browser window.

## Movement

Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the player **left**, **right**, **up**, and **down**.

## Collisions

If your player touches one of the enemy bugs, you will be reset to your starting position. **Don't get caught!**

## Winning

Once you reach the safety of the water on the other end of the board, you'll have won the game, and player will be reset again.
